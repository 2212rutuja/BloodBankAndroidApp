## Features

- **Real-time Inventory Management:** Utilizes a custom tray with NodeMCU, load cells, and HX711 for accurate blood bag counting by weight, ensuring real-time inventory tracking.

- **User Authentication:** Securely integrated with Firebase for user authentication, providing a reliable and safe environment for donors and recipients.

- **Messaging System:** Implements a messaging feature to notify donors to donate after 90 days. Admins receive alerts when blood bag count falls below 2, enabling timely communication.

- **User Interaction:** Empowers donors to review and update their information. Users can request a specific amount of blood bags, and Blood Bank admins can efficiently accept or reject requests based on predefined conditions.

## Technologies Used

- **Android Studio:** Crafted the Android app using the versatile Android Studio.
  
- **Java & XML:** Utilized Java for backend functionality and XML for UI design, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user interface.

- **Firebase:** Leveraged Firebase for secure user authentication and efficient data management.

- **Arduino IDE:** Employed Arduino IDE for the custom tray's development, integrating hardware seamlessly into the app's functionality.
